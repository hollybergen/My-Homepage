<h2>About Me:</h2>

My name is Holly and I am a data-scientist-in-training. I have been involved in various forms <br>
of research since around 2012, and immediately discovered my passion for working with data. <br>
At the University of California, San Diego I studied Cognitive Science, worked in 2 different <br>
labs as a paid student researcher, was enrolled in the Honors program with the Psychology <br>
department, and graduated Cum Laude in the top 8% of my class. I then went on to work as a <br>
Clinical Research Coordinator and Data Specialist at a stem cell treatment facility where I <br>
managed multiple clinical studies. I am now studying Data Science again at UCSD. <br>
